# Codebase Research

## Overview

When working with unfamiliar codebases, use this skill to build comprehensive understanding before making changes. Acts as a **technical documentarian** to explain the codebase as it exists through parallel Explore agent dispatch.

## When to Use (Auto-Discovery Triggers)

**using-flows should recommend this skill when it detects:**
- User mentions: "unfamiliar codebase", "don't know this project", "new to this code"
- User asks: "how does X work?", "what does this codebase do?", "where is Y?"
- Task involves debugging or modifying unfamiliar code
- Documentation is missing or outdated
- User is starting work on inherited/legacy code

**Common trigger phrases:**
- "I need to understand this codebase"
- "What does this project do?"
- "Where do I start with this code?"
- "How is X implemented here?"
- "This is a new codebase to me"
