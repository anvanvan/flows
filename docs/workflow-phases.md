# Skill Workflow Phases

## Overview
Skills are organized by development lifecycle phases to guide natural workflow progression.

## Phase Structure

```
00-meta/          ← Start here to understand the system
    ↓
01-understanding/ ← Comprehend existing code
    ↓
02-planning/      ← Design and architecture
    ↓
03-preparation/   ← Set up safety nets
    ↓
04-implementation/← Write code

```

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Purpose | Key Skills |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 00-meta | Learn the system | using-flows, writing-skills |
| 01-understanding | Analyze code | codebase-research, pattern-discovery, knowledge-lineages |
| 02-planning | Design solutions | brainstorming, writing-plans, when-stuck |
| 03-preparation | Prepare safety | characterization-testing, using-git-worktrees |
| 04-implementation | Build features | test-driven-development, strangler-fig-pattern |
| 05-debugging | Solve problems | systematic-debugging, root-cause-tracing |
| 06-validation | Verify quality | verification-before-completion, requesting-code-review |
| 07-completion | Ship work | finishing-a-development-branch, handoff |

## New Skills from Integration

- **knowledge-lineages** (01): Trace historical context
- **when-stuck** (02): Problem-solving dispatcher
- **characterization-testing** (03): Legacy code safety net
- **strangler-fig-pattern** (04): Incremental replacement

## Enhanced Skills

- **codebase-research**: Now includes code-archaeology techniques
- **systematic-debugging**: Requires characterization-testing for legacy code
